 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]\n3'
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums of length n and a positive integer k.
 * 
 * The power of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences
 * with their sum equal to k.
 * 
 * Return the sum of power of all subsequences of nums.
 * 
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 
 * 
 * Output:   6 
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * There are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:
 * 
 * 
 * The subsequence [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 3: [1,2,3] and
 * [1,2,3].
 * The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
 * The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
 * The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
 * The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
 * 
 * 
 * Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:   nums = [2,3,3], k = 5 
 * 
 * Output:   4 
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * There are 3 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:
 * 
 * 
 * The subsequence [2,3,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 5: [2,3,3] and
 * [2,3,3].
 * The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].
 * The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].
 * 
 * 
 * Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 7 
 * 
 * Output:   0 
 * 
 * Explanation:Â There exists no subsequence with sum 7. Hence all subsequences
 * of nums have power = 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 1 <= k <= 100
 * 
 *
